### LoRA: Low-Rank Adaptation of LLMs
[SourcePaper 2021](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.09685)

- Explain of Low-Rank
    - The rank of a matrix is the number of linearly independent rows or columns in the matrix.
    - Low-rank Approximation of Matrix
        - A matrix $M$ of size $m x n$ and rank $r$ can be decomposed into a pair of matrices $L_k$ and $R_k$ 
        - When $k = r$, the matrix $M$ can be exactly reconstructed from the decomposition.
        - When $k < r$, then the decomposition provides a low-rank approximation $\hat{M}$ of $M$.

- LoRA
    - for pre-trained parameters, using low-rank decomposition, add these low-rank adaptation to each layer.
    - When finetuning, freezes the parameters of pre-trained LLMs, only update the added adaptations
    - For inference, choose different adaptation based on the user/requests.

- whether LoRA parameters can be merged into the pre-trained parameters?
    - form dLoRA
    - Yes, At the inference time, as shown in Figure 1(b), LoRA can merge the multiplied matrix $B×A$ (i.e., ∆W) into W to eliminate extra inference overhead.
        - No additional inference overhead
        - but longer queuing delya
    - Or we can execute the pre-trained parameter $W$ and adapters ($A_i, B_i$) seperately
        - Shorter queuing delay
        - but extra computational costs

- Whether LoRA only works for FFN Layer?
    - No, The original paper applying LoRA for transformer, use LoRA for $W_q, W_k, W_v, W_o$
    - Typically, this adjustment is only applied to the query, key, value, and output projection matrices in the self-attention module, excluding the feed-forward module.

##### Key Point
- <spin style="color:red"> LoRA has very low storage and memory overheads. Each fine-tuned model only adds 0.1% to 1% of the model weight</spin>
- Serve multiple LoRA models in a shared GPU cluster
    - Here, execute the LoRA and base model seperately; and A user request contains the identifier of the LoRA model and a prompt.
    - Each GPU loads the backbone pre-trained LLMs
    - Only the LoRA components of models are swapped in from remote storage when serving.

- Challenges & Solutions
    - How to run multiple LoRA models efficiently on a GPU?
        - a new CUDA kernel for adding the LoRA addons to the backbone computation in a batched manner (Segmented Gather Matrix-Vector Multiplication (SGMV / BGMV))
        - pads the adapters of smaller ranks to the higest rank to perform batch operations

    - how to design an efficient system on top of SGMV for multi-tenant LoRA model serving?

- Asychronous loading
    - implement layer-by-layer or matrix-by-matrix loading
    - If the LoRA parameters need migrated from Host to GPU, let the GPU continue running other inputs in the batch

- Request migration
    - When a GPU run out of space for KV cache, migrate some requests to other GPUs.
    - opts recomputation instead of KV cache migration

### S-LoRA: Serving Thousands of Concurrent LoRA Adapters 
Institution: UC Berkerlay 
Conference: MLSys 2024
Paper Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03285 

##### Key Point
- Main Idea
    - In LoRA, swapping adapters by adding and subtracting LoRA weights from the base model. It significantly reduces overall serving throughput and increases total latency when serving multiple adapters concurrently.
    - Especially for batching

- Observations
    - <span style="color:red;">adapters with varying sizes and operations</spin>
    - the dimention of LoRA parameters is (R, H), H is the hidden size. While the KV Cache's dimention is (S, H), S refers sequence length. has similar dimention size H.

- Challenges for many LoRA adapters
    - <span style="color:red;">adapters with varying sizes</spin>, coupled with the dynamic allocation and deallocation of KV cache, can lead to memory fragmentation and I/O overhead.
    - the separated computation of many adapters with distinct ranks in noncontiguous memory is challenging to batch and demands the development of new computation kernels.

- Design Overview
    - seperate the computation of base-model and LoRA parameters
    
    <img src="./pictures/S-LoRA-seperate-lora-exec.png" width=400>

    - store all LoRA adapters in Host memory, only fetch used LoRAs to GPU.
    - To increase GPU utilization, use large batch-size and reduce the number of actived adapters: prioritize batching requests that use the same adapter
        - Use Dynamic Batching
    
    <img src="./pictures/S-LoRA-overview.png">

    - For challenge 1: memory management
        - Challenges:
            - memory fragmentation caused by the dynamic loading and offloading adapter weigts(variable size)
                - which adapter is active depends on the requests
            - the migration latency of loading/offloading
        - Solutions:
            - 1, based on Observation 2 and pagedAttention, use Unified Paging to manage KVCache and Adapter's parameters.
                - the memory pool is managed in pages
                - each page contains a verctor of H (hidden-size)
                - KV cache contains S page, Adapter contains R page.
            - 2, prefetching adapter weights
                - While running the current decoding batch, we predict the adapters required for the next batch based on the current waiting queue.

- the Multi-size Batched Gather Matrix-Vector Multiplication (MBGMV) kernel
    - not use padding
    - the performance of MBGMV depends on the average rank
    - introducing additional performance overhead for computing homegeneous ranks

### dLoRA: Dynamically Orchestrating Requests and Adapters for LoRA LLM Serving 
Conference: OSDI 2024 
Institution: PKU 
Paper Link: https://www.usenix.org/conference/osdi24/presentation/wu-bingyang 

##### Key Point
- Challenges
    - Merged inference (directly merge LoRA parameters to pre-trained Models) may cause low GPU utilization.
        - Observation show only 50% GPU utilization
        - Reason: when one LoRA adapter is processing, the requests in batch relys on other LoRA adapters need to be wait. (Longer Queuing delay)
        - Merged inference only works for single adapter scenario
    - Severe load imbalance
        - The burst of variable requests leads to severe load imbalance under staitc LoRA placement
        - Input and output lengths of requests are highly variable

- Design Overview
    - dynamically orchestrate requests and LoRA adapters
        - cluster level
        - process requests to different LoRA adapters in a single batch
    - For challenge 1:
        - dLoRA can dynamically merge and unmerge LoRA adapters with the base model in each worker replica.
        - New Challenges: 
            1, How to decide when to merge and unmerge adapters;
            2, Switching overhead + scheduling overhead
                - Switching overhead >= decoding iteration time
                - Complex scheduling at the granularity of the iteration incurs overhead
    - For challenge 2:
        - dLoRA can dynamically migrate LoRA adapters and requests between worker replicas.
        - New Challenges: 1, How to decide which adapters and requests to migrate;

    - Overview:
        - dLoRA deploys a set of workers in a cluster, each replica contains a subset of LoRA adapters and one base model on several GPUs
        - Intra-replica, use dynamic batching
            - decoding across several iterations, even though the switch overhead is bigger than decoding iteration time, still can be amortized.
            - use historical: set break point on iteration granularity; 
                - Upon reaching a break point, the algorithm tunes the thresholds based on the data collected from the preceding period
                - based on the throughput of adapters
        - Inter-replicas, use dynamic balancing
            - proactive mechanism
                - In the long term, The workload pattern exhibit predictablity and periodicity, such as low load at midnight and high load during day time.
                - Based on this, preload needed LoRA adapters to GPU memory
            - reactive mechanism
                - the load imbalance caused by variable input and output length
                - use dynamic adapter-request co-migration
                    - migrate LoRA adapters and requests (with intermediate states) from over-loaded replicas to others.


### CaraServe: CPU-Assisted and Rank-Aware LoRA Serving for Generative LLM Inference
Conference: ArXiv 20 Jan 2024
Institution: HKUST  
Paper Link: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.11240  

##### Key Point
- Main Idea
    - maintains the base model on GPUs and dynamically loads activated LoRA adapters from main memory.
    - employs CPU-assisted approach to reduce the cold-start latency (load selected LoRA parameters to GPU)  
    $$
    \hat{y} = xW + xAB = x\hat{W}
    $$

    <img src="./pictures/CaraServe-CPU-assisted-LoRA.png" width=350>

- Challenges:
    - C1: high cold-start overhead
        - the migration latency caused by loading LoRA adapters from the host to GPU
        - under continuous batching (when new requests arrives, preempts running decoding and prefill new requests, then get togather and run decoding): if new requests keeps arriving, these cold-start overheads cumulatively delays the token generation of an in-flight requests.
        - In figure 3, account 10%, 16% and 20% of  the entire request serving time when the aggregate load is 3, 6, and 9 requests per second

        <img src="./pictures/CaraServe-cold-start-overheads.png" width=350>

    - C2: Request scheduling for heterogeneous LoRA serving
        - selected LoRA adapters with varying ranks
        - <spin style="color:red">**Observation: significant performance variations when batching different sets of heterogeneous adapters.**</spin>
            - Based on Punica and S-LoRA:
                - BGMA kernel in Punica pads the adapters of smaller ranks to the higest rank to perform batch operations
                - MBGMA kernel in S-LoRA does not use padding, it's performance depends on the average ranks
            - scheduling adapters with different rank in similar instance cause latency varying

        <img src="./pictures/CaraServe-varying-latency-vs-scheduling.png" width=450>

- Design Details
    - <spin style="color:red">**A parameter-efficient adapter, LoRA requires lightweight computation and can run on either GPU or CPU**</spin>
    - use CPU-assisted LoRA execution to overlap the adapter loading with the prefill computation.
        - New C1: the synchronization between CPU and GPU (as some LoRA process is on CPU and the Base LLM is executed on GPU)
        - New C2: frequent triggering of LoRA computations => high invocation overheads (increase inference latency by 79.4%)
        - New C3: offloading the heavy prefill computation to the CPU may create a new bottleneck due to its limited parallelism compared with GPU. (<spin style="color:red">Whether with small batch_size, the execution latency is smaller than load to GPU + execute on GPU</spin>)

        <img src="./pictures/CaraServe-CPU&GPU.png" width=400>

    - Efficient GPU-CPU LoRA Coordination
        - Sync free CPU LoRA invocation
            - the LoRA adapters may exists both in GPU and CPU, the $F_4$ means the LoRA execution, $F_1$ represent the Base model execution.
            - In native way(Pytorch), $F_2$ aims to transfer the input matrix to the host memory. Once the data transfer completes, $F_3$ is called to notify CPU execute $xAB$.
            - <spin style="color:red">*Why two $F_2$ and $F_3$?*</spin>
            - **Solutions**: implement asynchronous CU kernel for $F_3$ and $F_2$

            <img src="./pictures/CaraServe-Sync-free-CPU-LoRA-invocation.png" width=400>

        - Shared memory data transfer
            - reduce the inter-process communication 

        - Profiling-guided LoRA parallelization
            - using multiple CPU cores
            - set the maximum workload for a single CPU (eg. if one core can handle c tokens, when insert B requests with L tokens. we can allocate [$\frac{L}{c}$]) cores to compute the adaptation results to each request with weight $W$
            - Compared to the PyTorch's native multi-threading modules (Data parallelism), achieves 1.7x speedup when use 8 CPUs.

            <img src="./pictures/CaraServe-parallelism.png" width=400>
    
    - rank-aware scheduling (For Challenge 2)
        - the heterogeneous LoRA adapters with varying ranks
        - develop genetic performance models to **predict the prefill and decoding latency** of a specific batch of heterogenous adapters
        - Based on the <spin style="color:red">**Observation: on specific GPU,  the performance of decoding latency is almost linear to**:
            - **the product of batch size and the maximum rank encountered (BGMV)**
            - **the sum of LoRA ranks(MBGMV) in the batch.**</spin>

##### Questions
- High-quality LLM apps often need multiple LLM requests to collaborate indifferent workflows.

- Existing services only observe tons of individual requests, without knowing any application-level information.

##### Motivation & Challenges
- Excessive overhead of consecutive requests
    - For These long context applications, the overhead comes from network and queuing is pretty large.

- Misaligned Scheduling Objectives
    - the existing works focus on improve the "individual latency", But the users mainly focus on end-to-end latency.
    - disaggregation between different type's tasks

    - we can determine the ideal scheduling strategy, maximize the throughput.
- Redundant computations
    - Currently, most LLM-based applications exhibit a high degree of redundancy in the prompts of their requests.
    - This is why more than 94% of prefix tokens could be repetitively used across LLM requests for various users

##### Key Point
- Use multi-agent to solve TQA tasks
- Problems: a type of tasks called tabular question answering(TQA)
    - TQA focusing on providing answers from tables in response to a user’s natural language (NL) inquiry
        - tables have complex forms, especially when tasks relys on multi-tables
- Multi-Agent:
    - the User, responsible for receiving the user’s natural language inquiry;
    - the Planner, tasked with creating an execution plan for the user’s inquiry; 
    - the Engineer, responsible for executing the plan step-by-step;
    - the Executor, provides various execution environments (e.g., text-toSQL) to fulfll specifc tasks assigned by the Engineer; 
    - the Critic, responsible for judging whether to complete the user’s natural language inquiry and identifying gaps between the current results and initial tasks. 
- More complicated: a cycle with feedback
